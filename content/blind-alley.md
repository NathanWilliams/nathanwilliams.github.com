I have been hacking away at reading Minecraft [anvil] files on and off now for over a month.
By the time I started to see results, I realised I had a teetering pile of code that was becoming hard to work with, let alone explain!

So I am scrapping it and starting again, and this time I am going to document functions, and be less carefree with import!
Something good has come from this aimless hacking though, and that is a better understanding of anvil and chunks.
I feel like I better understand the concept of "writing one to throw away", it is a training exercise, or a scouting mission in a dark mineshaft!

So the next series of posts will be small and focused on specific areas of functionality, eventually building up to a more complete anvil / chunk reading library.
