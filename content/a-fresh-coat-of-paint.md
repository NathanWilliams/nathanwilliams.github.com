I have wanted to get back to blogging for quite a while, but I kept being put off by octopress.
I'm more of a Python guy when it comes to scripting, and while I respect Ruby, it isn't one that works for my brain.

I also hated how the content and code were mixed, it simply seems wrong.

So now I am giving [Pelican][pelican] a try.

Not sure when or what I will write about next, but cleaning the slate is a start.
